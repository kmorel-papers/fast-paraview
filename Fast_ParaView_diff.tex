ParaView is one of the most prominent software tools for scientific visualization used by scientists around the world.
Color is a primary conduit to visually map data to its representation and thus enable investigation and interpretation of the data.
Colormap selection has a significant impact on the data revealed; its design and selection is a critical aspect of scientific data visualization.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The most }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{A }\DIFaddend common choice for a user is the program's default colormap, so careful consideration of this default is consequential.
Although the current default colormap in ParaView, a succession of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{colors from cool to warm}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hues from cool blue to warm red}\DIFaddend , has served the community well, research shows that more nuanced colormap configurations increase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{discrinimability while maintaining the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discriminability while maintaining }\DIFaddend other critical metrics.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This inspires }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These findings inspire }\DIFaddend us to revisit and update the default colors in ParaView.
Here we present a new ParaView default colormap, the criteria and methods of development, and example visualizations and analytic metrics.

\chapteri{T}he colormap is a critical part of any pseudocolor visualization.
A colormap is a simple function that maps numbers to colors, which can then be applied to visually \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{categorize data, highlight data, or }\DIFaddend represent a continuous distribution of values over a surface or volume.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend The colormap is most recognizable to users as a bar painted with a transition of colors representing a range of numbers from low to high.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend When presented with these colors, a viewer makes \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{determinations of the values represented by these numbers and }\DIFaddend the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{reverse translation from colors back to numbers , and the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{patterns they form.
The }\DIFaddend efficacy of a pseudocolor visualization depends on a person's ability to perceive and translate these colors.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Ideally, each visualization would have a colormap tailored to the specifics of its data, tasks, and audience, but this is usually impractical.
}\DIFaddend A typical user is unlikely to be a color expert, so it is imperative that the visualization system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{make good choices}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide sound options that accurately and impartially represent the data}\DIFaddend . It is particularly important to have a good default colormap that is used in the absence of any further configuration. Many users will have neither the inclination nor the proficiency to change the default colors selected by the visualization system.

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Here we present the new default colormap design for Paraview, a scientific visualization software application used throughout the scientific community to visualize large, complex datasets in both 2D and 3D space. }\DIFaddend The authors of this paper are longtime contributors to the ParaView scientific visualization application~\cite{Ahrens2005}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ParaView is a general-purpose tool that is used across many scientific domains and that often applies colors in a virtual 3D space. These properties raise unique challenges for color choices }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin

\DIFadd{Default colormaps must balance the needs of many users. This raises distinct challenges for colormap construction }\DIFaddend in ParaView and similar \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{products}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{scientific visualizaton software}\DIFaddend .
Care has been taken to choose colors \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and colormaps }\DIFaddend in ParaView that work well in a variety of contexts.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Because ParaView supports switching among these views or multiple views together and because ParaView keeps colors consistent across them for clarity, the default colors must be adept when displayed in any of these contexts.
}\DIFaddend This paper describes the criteria and rationale behind the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{default color choices in ParaView, focusing on the most recent changes to the application.
These changes arise from over 10 years working }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{construction choices in the new default colormap in ParaView.
The criteria and specific changes stem from over a decade of collaboration }\DIFaddend with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and other institutions.

Early versions of ParaView used the \huewheel, shown \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the left of Figure~\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the left in Figure~\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend , as the default colormap.
This colormap is formed by interpolating along the hues, typically from blue to red, in the HSV color space.
(Note that this colormap is often referred to as the ``Rainbow'' colormap, but we avoid that name to remove confusion with other maps designed with colors from the rainbow.)
\huewheel is a common choice as it is the simplest way to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{produce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{program }\DIFaddend a sequence of many vibrant colors.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, because these colors are defined by the physics of display technology rather than the physiology of vision, the colors are unevenly distributed and can cause features to be inappropriately accentuated or diminished.
}\DIFdelend Although the criticisms of the \huewheel colormap were known even at the inception of the ParaView software~\cite{Rogowitz1998}, there were few practical alternatives.

It was when Borland and Taylor~\cite{Borland2007} admonished ParaView \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by name }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and other visualization programs }\DIFaddend that the developers became motivated to improve their default colormap design.
After adapting the best recommendations available at the time and drawing inspiration from the GIS community, which had extensive color map recommendations~\cite{Brewer2003}, the team settled on a \coolwarm colormap design~\cite{Moreland2009} shown in the center \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{panel }\DIFaddend of Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend .
This map adopts a diverging colormap approach with a smoothed luminance profile in the transition between hues.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Since the introduction of the \coolwarm colormap as the default in ParaView, many practitioners have proposed alternate maps~\cite{Samsel2015}, and multiple perceptual studies have been conducted to evaluate these colormaps~\cite{Ware2017}.
Some show that the \coolwarm colormap performs less well than its alternatives, particularly with respect to its discriminability~\cite{Ware2017,Ware2019}.
Consequently, the ParaView development team has been motivated to revisit its default colormap\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and potentially change it}\DIFdelend .

This paper describes the processes we undertook to design a new default colormap for ParaView, which we dub ``\fast\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.''Use of this colormap  can be seen in the right hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'', shown on the right }\DIFaddend side of Figure\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend .
We describe the criteria we used in designing this colormap\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, go through the process of iteratively refining colors to get us to our final map, get }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: the iterative design process; refining the hue selection; smoothing the transitions; distributing the final colormap to get }\DIFaddend feedback from current users\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the software, and use perceptual modelsto make }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; evaluation using perceptual models; and making the }\DIFaddend final refinements.

\DIFaddend \section{CRITERIA}

There are many guidelines for colormaps proposed in the literature. We use the collection compiled by Bujack et al.~\cite{Bujack2018} as a guide. The characteristics most important to us, in no particular order, are as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Discriminative \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{powers}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{power}\DIFaddend } --
  We wish to maximize the number of just noticeable differences in the colormap to make subtle differences visible.
\item \emph{Uniformity} --
  The perceptual difference between colors should be commensurate with the difference in the numbers they represent.
\item \emph{Smoothness} --
  The rate of change of coloring should be uniform along with the difference in colors themselves.
  This is particularly important for the luminance profile where a sharp change from increasing to decreasing brightness can cause undesired bands.
\item \emph{Order} --
  The color sequence should have an easy to intuit, or at least easy to remember, progression from low to high values.
  The colors should follow natural interpretations and accepted conventions where possible.
\item \emph{Robustness to shading on 3D surfaces} -- Shading, which darkens a surface based on its orientation with respect to the light source and viewer, is vital in perceiving shape.
  If a surface is painted with overly dark colors, the shading becomes indiscernible\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-shading}.
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.
  %DIF > as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-shading}.
}\DIFaddend \item \emph{Robustness to colorblindness} --
  The colors should be distinguishable for the many users with various types and degrees of colorblindness.
\item \emph{Aesthetically pleasing} --
  Although quite subjective, ParaView users should generally be pleased with the new colors.

\end{itemize}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{It should be noted that these characteristics }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These critera }\DIFaddend are not independent \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and improvements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{improvements as changes }\DIFaddend in one property could degrade the effectiveness in others.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, issues with order, 3D surfaces, or colorblindess are typically resolved by limiting the colors used,
but reducing the number of colors lowers the discriminative power of the map. Consequently, there is no such thing as the perfect color map.

\section {\DIFadd{COLORMAPS \& ARTISTIC COLOR THEORY}}

\DIFadd{Colormaps come in a wide variety, categorized loosely by their luminance distribution and number of ramps.
%DIF > and designed to address different visualization tasks, data distributions as well as the needs and conventions of the science domain.
General categories include discrete, linear, diverging, isoluminent, and more custom constructions such as wave maps.
Discrete colormaps contain specific hues without interpolation between hues.
Linear maps, colormaps that span one value ramp, enable intuitive identification of scalar values and equalized attention across the visualization but contain lower discriminatory power due to the monotonic luminance profile ramp and a narrow range of hues.
Diverging maps are colormaps that contain two abutting value ramps, which provides addition discriminatory power.
}\coolwarm\DIFadd{, }\blueorange\DIFadd{, and }\fast \DIFadd{are all examples of diverging maps.
Isolumient colormaps hold advantages for specific uses but suffer from low discriminatory power as by definition they seek to limit the luminance.
%DIF > range as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ware}. \km{The figure shows no isolumant maps}.
}

\DIFadd{As a base for our discussion, it will be helpful to understand a bit about Artistic Color Contrast Theory \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Itten, Albers}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
. Artistic Color Contrast Theory, the foundation of painting since the Renaissance, is a set of principles that drive the characteristics and interactions and of colors. The principles center on the seven types of color contrast~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Itten}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.
The first three are
}\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item \DIFadd{contrast of hue,
}\item \DIFadd{contrast of saturation, and
}\item \DIFadd{contrast of luminance, which are familiar as they align with parameters of HSL and other color spaces.
Two more are
}\item \DIFadd{cool-warm contrast and
}\item \DIFadd{complimentary contrast, both of which involve colors on opposite sides of the color wheel.
The remaining two are
}\item \DIFadd{simultaneous contrast at play in the }\huewheel \DIFadd{colormap and
}\item \DIFadd{contrast of extension, which speaks to balance of the area covered by specific hues.
}\end{inparaenum}

\DIFadd{Colormaps translate data, not through the colors themselves, but through the }\textit{\DIFadd{contrast}} \DIFadd{between perceivable colors within the colormap. In discrete colormaps it is the contrast between the individual colors that reveals the data. Scalar colormaps are smooth ramps generated by selecting a set of control points and then interpolating between the control points in CIELAB colorspace. The discriminatory power in a colormap relies on the contrast across its entire path through colorspace, which includes both the control points and the colors on the path through color space.
}

\DIFadd{Figure~\ref{fig:contrast} illustrates the impact of increasing the ranges of luminance, saturation and hue. All of the examples begin with the }\coolwarm \DIFadd{colormap as a base.
%DIF > The data range is clipped to concentrate the contrast in the bow waves, which is the area of interest.
%DIF > The figure contains three diverging colormaps to illustrate specific types of contrast: luminance, saturation, and hue.
%DIF > The left-side visualization is rendered in the \coolwarm colormap, the following figures start with the \coolwarm and increase the range and thus the contrast within hue, saturation and luminance. The next panel is the same data in the \coolwarm colormap, altered by increasing the luminance range from a very light gray to black. The center panel shows the \coolwarm with with saturation range extended into full saturation. Next, the luminance and saturation ranges of the \coolwarm are held steady while increasing the hue across the cool hues on the left side of the map and the warm hues on the right. The figure provides an illustration of the impact of extending contrast. In this data, the increase in the luminance range provides a bit more clarity, the increase in hue simply adds confusion. The last panel shows degrees of increase in all three channels but balanced to serve a wide range of data types and distributions. 
%DIF > The hue contrast is between red and blue; saturated, warm hues against a muted tan hue; luminance, black and white.
%DIF > On right, multiple types on contrasts are combined: hue, the range of cool colors in the blue green ramp; saturation, the saturated cool hues with the muted tan hue; luminance, the dark greens and blues against the light tan; and a subtle cool warm contrast between the cool blue to green range and the warm yellow tan in the upper range.
%DIF > The luminance alone provides clear differentiation of the large features but does not capture the nuance shown in the saturation contrast example.
Each increase in contrast type demonstrates greater detail than the original }\coolwarm \DIFadd{it comes from.
However, having such dramatic contrast can interfere with other elements of a display such as shading, background, and labeling.
Figure~\ref{fig:contrast} shows at right how the }\fast \DIFadd{colormap combines more subtle versions of all these types of contrast to achieve the same improvement without dominating color features.
}

%DIF > \km{I am thoroughly confused by this description. The description in the text does not match the description in the caption. Is this meant to say that the first image shows hue contrast, the second saturation contrast, etc.? If so, how is the left image not also showing, say, cool-warm contrast? Why is the third image (luminance contrast?) two solid colors but the others gradients?}

%DIF > \fs{The point of this figure is to show the primary types of contrast - hue, sat and ,value, applied to data. People understand the verbal description of contrast types but it I find that in order to get buy in you need to illustrate the concepts on data.
%DIF > I am always surprised when I get asked things like what is a muted color.what are the cool colors, etc. This figure was to lay the foundation for understanding what those mean. Yes, they all have multiple types of contrast but that cant be avoided.}

%DIF > \km{If the last image is a combination of contrasts, why not show \fast? }

%DIF > \fs{Fast is a compromise and thus does not present as clear an example of the impact of multiple types of contrast.}

%DIF > \km{And what are the images supposed to demonstrate? Are some showing detail not seen in the others?}

%DIF > \fs{to some degree yes but the point is to help them make the translation between adjusting the characteristics of a colormap and how that impacts what you see.}

%DIF > \km{That is really my confusion. I get that the pictures are supposed to show me how the characteristics impact what I see, but apart from different colors I see pretty much the same thing in each picture. Maybe if it was explicitly said what is different about each one that would help.}

%DIF > \fs{None of these issues are hills I want to die on. Happy to make changes. It would be easier to discuss as we approach the topic differently.}

%DIF > \km{Generally, I liked reading your discussion of the different types of contrast. This was new to me and I'm very curious about I would apply this. The problem for me (and I think I am part of the target audiance) is that the picture never brought it together. I look at it, say, yup the colors are different, but otherwise I don't immediately see how one might be ``better'' than another. At the very least, we should be able to point to the right image and identify something better than each other image independently, but I don't clearly see that.}


\DIFadd{Selecting a colormap best suited to specific tasks, datasets, and data distributions is key to maximizing the capability of color to translate data; however, it is a time-consuming process.
}

\DIFadd{Creating custom colormaps requires time and color expertise. Even scientists who have taken our color tutorials report that while they understand the value of custom colormaps and have devoted time to customizing maps for their data, they report that }\DIFaddend it is a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{master at none.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{challenging process that often does not produce improvements on the default or other readily available options.
}\DIFaddend 


%DIF > \km{Is the use of the word ``hue'' here consistent with how it is used elsewhere in the paper? Throughout the paper, we consider hue as one color property in a hue-saturation-luminance model. The linear maps described above (sometimes) change only saturation and luminance, leaving hue alone. Thus, when this paragraph states that colormaps translate data only through contrast of hues, that would mean that a linear map provides no data because it has no change of hue. Does the paragraph more generally mean perceptual differences in color rather than just differences in hue?}
\DIFaddbegin 

%DIF > \fs{Yes, it is confusing. In my community hue refers  hue as you describe it but is also how we speak of individual colors, especially ones that are nuanced and without a specific name. I changed hue to colors and tried to clarify. If you have another suggestion, let me know.}

\DIFadd{Ware et al. \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Ware2017} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
tested the internal contrast levels of commonly used colormaps.
The results, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ware}, graph the amount of contrast across the colormaps.
It illustrates the uneven contrast distribution of }\huewheel\DIFadd{, the more consistent higher level of contrast in both }\blueorange \DIFadd{and }\extendedcoolwarm \DIFadd{(an alternative to }\blueorange \DIFadd{using extended hues from }\coolwarm\DIFadd{), and the shortcomings of other standards.
}



\DIFadd{Colormaps with high discriminatory power employ multiple types of contrast across the map.
Looking at Figure~\ref{Larsen3}, }\huewheel \DIFadd{relies on hue and simultaneous contrast, }\coolwarm \DIFadd{narrows the hue range but gains contrast by adding two cropped luminance ranges.
Fast, like }\huewheel \DIFadd{includes a wide range of hue, a range of saturation levels, two robust luminance ranges, and complimentary contrast created by the inclusion of blue and orange hues.
When constructing colormaps there are always trade-offs about which types and how much contrast should be included.
The goal is to maximize the contrast between the internal hues, while maintaining harmony across the colormap.
}



%DIF > For this reason, default colormaps need to be constructed to address the needs of a wide range of data types and distributions. Given that color is our primary means of revealing the data, the default colormap is a critical component of any visualization program.

%DIF > The \huewheel colormap provided adequate discriminatory power when the range of data is small and detail is not required. However, as the data grows, the discriminatory power within colormaps needs to be increased to keep pace.

\DIFadd{The most common request we receive from scientists is higher feature resolution, a property driven by the internal contrast levels within the colormap.
Larger numbers of control points enable one to build higher levels of internal contrast; however they disrupt the ease of adjusting the map to align with specific data.
}\fast \DIFadd{has nine control point, balancing these conflicting interests.
Future work includes addressing this trade-off by an automating the rescaling on the control point distribution.
}

%DIF > It is worth noting that colormaps with larger numbers of control points are able to attain greater discriminatory power due to the greater control of hues sequences. However, here we have limited the number of control points as they make it difficult to adjust the hue distribution to meet the needs of your data while maintaining the even progression of contrast distribution.

The origins of the new default color map arise from a collaboration between climate scientists, visualization experts, and visual artists~\cite{Samsel2015}.
The team found that the existing default colors do not reveal enough detail within the high-resolution data they use.
This collaboration engendered the \blueorange colormap (Figure~\ref{fig:design:blueorange}), which better satisfies the needs of the climate scientists~\cite{Samsel2015:SC}.
This colormap is built on the same principles as the \coolwarm colormap (Figure~\ref{fig:design:coolwarm}) but \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with expanded ranges of contrast using more }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{expanded the internal contrast incorporating longer paths through }\DIFaddend hue, saturation, and luminance\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, a principal well documented for increasing internal contrast \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend The \blueorange colormap improves on the discriminating power of \coolwarm by increasing the range of all available color channels without violating robustness to colorblindness.
First, the brightness range is expanded by dropping the brightness at each end.
This increases the luminance profile, which is known to be the most powerful channel for visual discrimination, particularly for high-frequency data \cite{Ware2019}.
The hue range is also expanded by
\DIFaddbegin \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item \DIFaddend mixing green into the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lighter colorsand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{light cool colors,
}\item \DIFadd{mixing yellow and orange into to light warm range, and
}\item \DIFaddend moving the darker colors toward purple \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and maroon.
}\end{inparaenum}
\DIFaddend The saturation is also significantly increased across the color map to bring more vibrancy and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend more clearly distinguish between the hues.
User studies like that in Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ware}
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:ware}
}\DIFaddend show the \blueorange colormap to be better than the original \coolwarm colormap and overall one of the best performing colormaps \cite{Ware2017,Ware2019,Turton2017}.

\DIFdelend The success of the \blueorange colormap, which shares features with \coolwarm, suggests that improvements could be made.
A reasonable impulse would be to simply establish \blueorange as the default ParaView colormap.
However, the \blueorange colormap design comes from a particular collaboration with climate scientists studying ocean temperature and is thus developed specifically for their needs.
Because it was created with a narrow focus of customers, it has some characteristics that make it unsuitable for more general application.

%DIF > Figure~\ref{CCC1} shows the control points of \fast in the CCC-Tool\cite{Nardini2021} interface. We start by selecting and adjusting the control points in HSV space (left) as there the hues are intuitively adjustable. Once we are close to a the desired colormap, its control points are reviewed in CIElab (middle) which is useful for tuning the perceptual consistency of the map. In order to check the strength and distribution of the discriminatory power we review in the optimization metrics (bottom) section.

The iterative process involves balancing the smoothness, equal distribution of luminance, smooth hue transitions, as well as identify a path through turquoise and fuchsia, awkward transitions in digital colorspace. Like yellow, in their pure form they are lighter crisp. When darkened, they quickly become muddy, obscuring the hue.

For example, users may wish to adjust the colors to highlight particular regions of their scalar data.
This cannot be done easily with larger numbers of control points, so we removed any control points where interpolation produces nearly identical results.
Our final design has nine control points as it is the minimum needed to produce a smoothly transitioning map that moves through the hues we have selected.

%DIF < % This initial set of colormaps spawned a discussion among the ParaView development team and produced some mild opinions. These were used to cull down to three sets of maps that varied by: the luminance level, (darkness), at the ends of the colormap; the saturation levels across the colormap; and the smoothness and value of the center transition from cool to warm. All these colormap variations considered retained their perceptual uniformity and robustness to colorblindness.

\DIFdelend As we neared completion of the new colormap design, the development team wanted feedback from current users about these changes before being affected by them.
Sandia National Laboratories has a strong ParaView user base and an active support team for them.
The ParaView support team sent an email to the Sandia ParaView users informing them of planned changes and welcoming any feedback.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The email elicited feedback with the following open-ended text: ``The ParaView team is debating changing the default, as shown below. Note that users can always change back to our current map and palette. If anyone has any opinions on changes, please send your thoughts back to us.''
This was followed by a set of images comparing the }\coolwarm \DIFadd{colormap and an early version of }\fast \DIFadd{along with a potential change in background shade that was being considered.
}\DIFaddend 

Of the roughly 800 users receiving the email, 18 responded back with comments about the change of the default colormap from Cool to Warm to Fast.
Of these, 15 expressed a clear preference for the new colormap.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Only 1 preferred the original Cool to Warm colormapwith the remaining }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We made no attempt to quantify the rating of responses, but they ranged from very favorable (e.g., ``I’ll emphatically vote for the neutral gray background and FAST colormap.'' and ``I like the FAST colormap. Seems like it uses more of the color spectrum whereas the other only uses red, white, blue.'') whereas others only had a slight preference (e.g., ``I don’t have a strong opinion on the default color map; I would maybe lean towards the new one.'' and ``The new one does look a bit better, but the old one isn’t too bad either.'').
}

\DIFadd{Of the remaining 3 respondees, }\DIFaddend 2 \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{expressing no preference}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{did not express a strong preference.
One stated, ``The new/proposed color map seems fine, the minima/maxima seem a little dark to me personally.''
One respondee disapproved of any change but also would use neither colormap: ``I would never vote to change something that is working.  I also never ever use the default color map. I vote do not change.''
Only one respondee gave a preference to the }\coolwarm \DIFadd{colormap citing issues with banding on some displays: ``The one thing I’ll point out is that in the attached image, there appears to be more banding of colors resulting in sharper steps visually (particularly in the bottom half of the image). Probably this is just an artifact, but aside from the increased contrast, it makes me prefer the images }[\DIFaddend of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one over the other. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \coolwarm{}] \DIFadd{to the ones }[\DIFadd{of }\fast{}]\DIFadd{.''
}

\DIFaddend Although no formal study has been done, we see this \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{overall }\DIFaddend as a clear general preference \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for }\DIFaddend the new colormap.

\DIFdelend \section{PERCEPTUAL EVALUATION}

Although we have not yet had a chance to perform formal human subject studies, we are confident that \fast will outperform its predecessor, \coolwarm, in terms of discriminability.
In particular, \fast has a higher $\Delta$E discriminability metric.
As measured by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CCC Tool}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CCC-Tool}\DIFaddend ~\cite{Nardini2021}, \coolwarm has an average local CIE$\Delta$E2000 discriminability score of 120 whereas \fast has a score of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{174, and the other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{174. Other }\DIFaddend discriminability metrics similarly show improvements with \fast.
All that said, we recognize that \fast%
%DIF < , shown in Figure \ref{Ast},
%DIF > , shown in Figure \ref{Larsen3},
likely performs less well \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in general }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with respect to discriminability }\DIFaddend than the \blueorange colormap it is based on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
This is out of necessity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\blueorange \DIFadd{includes a larger luminence range, being darker on the ends and going to white in the center.
These changes were necessary in order }\DIFaddend to adjust for the smoothness and robustness to shading on 3D surfaces.

The \coolwarm colormap was designed about 15 years ago to move away from the \huewheel colormap and its rainbow colors because of the strong evidence at the time of its poor perceptual properties~\cite{Rogowitz1998,Borland2007,Ware1988,Light2004}.
In the interim, multiple colormaps based on the hues of the rainbow that correct some of the problems of the \huewheel have been designed.
More recent research suggests that added hues and more nameable colors can assist in color differentiations that are not otherwise explained by our perceptual color models \cite{Reda2021}.
This leads some to suggest that perceptually correct colormaps based on rainbow colormaps might be favorable \cite{Ware2023}.
Although the \fast colormap does not incorporate all rainbow hues, it does improve dramatically over the hues provided by \coolwarm\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as seen in the hue plots of Figure~\ref{Charts}}\DIFdelend .

\fast also has more namable colors than its \coolwarm predecessor.
Using the color categorization tendency metric proposed by Reda \cite{Reda2022}, \fast once again exceeds \coolwarm.
Using a color name similarity threshold of 0.6 (as was used by Reda), \coolwarm has a categorization tendency metric of 310 whereas \fast scores 369.
That said, \fast could likely be improved further by completing the rainbow with distinctive green hues (much like the \turbo colormap~\cite{Mikhailov2019} does).
However, these are all recent observations deserving more study, particularly for effects beyond discriminability.
Thus, we are not ready to loop back around to the full hues of a rainbow.


\section{CONCLUSION}

Our final iteration of the new colormap, which we dub ``\fast,''\DIFaddbegin \footnote{\DIFadd{The name }\fast \DIFadd{is meaningless, but was chosen as it is reminiscent of other colormap names like }\colormap{Jet} \DIFadd{and }\turbo\DIFadd{.}} \DIFaddend is demonstrated in Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Larsen3} }\DIFaddend as well as numerous other figures in this paper.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The colors are listed in Table~\ref{tab:colors}.
}\DIFaddend This colormap is provided as one of the available colormaps in ParaView~5.12 and will become the default colormap in ParaView~5.13.

\DIFdelend \begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Discriminative \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{powers}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{power}\DIFaddend } --
  \fast performs better on every color discriminability metric that we have available.
\item \emph{Uniformity} --
  The previous \coolwarm colormap has very little luminance change in its center leaving a region of colors that tend to get washed out (see \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure \ref{Larsen}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figures \ref{Larsen3} and \ref{fig:Matrix}}\DIFaddend ).
  \fast retains more luminance variation at its apex to help maintain a uniform perceptual change in that region.
\item \emph{Smoothness} --
  \fast sacrifices some smoothness at the center for gain in discrimination and uniformity, but the smoothness is close to \coolwarm and much better than \blueorange.
\item \emph{Order} --
  \coolwarm and \fast use the same cues of luminance and warmth for color order.
\item \emph{Robustness to shading on 3D surfaces} --
  \fast allows the end colors to become darker for greater discriminability.
  This makes shapes a bit harder but still possible to discern in the worst case scenario of values all at one end of the colormap range (see Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:3d-shading}).
  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig:Matrix}, right column).
  Although dark surfaces can be reveled with brighter lighting, such bright colors could wash out light colors.
  Requiring customized lighting is just pushing the problem back on the user again, so we discount this solution.
  It is also conceivable that changes in lightness could obfuscate the shape.
  Research for such an effect is lacking, but anecdotally we have not encountered such an occurrence.
}\DIFaddend \item \emph{Robustness to colorblindness} --
  Colorblindness was always kept in mind when designing \fast.
  Figure~\ref{fig:colorblindness} shows that \fast responds just as well to common forms of colorblindness as does \coolwarm.
\item \emph{Aesthetically pleasing} --
  Aesthetics are notoriously difficult to measure with any accuracy.
  However, voluntary responses from ParaView users suggest a preference for \fast.

\end{itemize}



With the introduction of \fast as the default colormap for ParaView, we make a significant improvement in the readability of colors in many visualizations produced.
