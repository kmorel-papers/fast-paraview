%\looseness-1
ParaView is one of the most prominent software tools for scientific visualization used by scientists around the world.
Color is a primary conduit to visually map data to its representation and thus enable investigation and interpretation of the data.
Colormap selection has a significant impact on the data revealed; its design and selection is a critical aspect of scientific data visualization.
The most common choice for a user is the program's default colormap, so careful consideration of this default is consequential.
Although the current default colormap in ParaView, a succession of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{colors from cool to warm}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{hues from cool blue to warm red}\DIFaddend , has served the community well, research shows that more nuanced colormap configurations increase \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{discrinimability while maintaining the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discriminability while maintaining }\DIFaddend other critical metrics. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{This inspires }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These findings inspire }\DIFaddend us to revisit and update the default colors in ParaView.
Here we present a new ParaView default colormap, the criteria and methods of development, and example visualizations and analytic metrics.

\chapteri{T}he colormap is a critical part of any pseudocolor visualization.
A colormap is a simple function that maps numbers to colors, which can then be applied to visually \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{categorize data, highlight data, or }\DIFaddend represent a continuous distribution of values over a surface or volume.

The colormap is most recognizable to users as a bar painted with a transition of colors representing a range of numbers from low to high.  
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend When presented with these colors, a viewer makes the reverse translation from colors back to numbers\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The }\DIFaddend efficacy of a pseudocolor visualization depends on a person's ability to perceive and translate these colors.  
\DIFaddbegin 

 \DIFaddend A typical user is unlikely to be a color expert, so it is imperative that the visualization system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{make good choices}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide sound options that accurately and impartially represent the data}\DIFaddend . It is particularly important to have a good default colormap that is used in the absence of any further configuration. Many users will have neither the inclination nor the proficiency to change the default colors selected by the visualization system.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Here we present the new default colormap design for Paraview, a scientific visualization software application used throughout the scientific community to visualize large, complex datasets in both 2D and 3D space. }\DIFaddend The authors of this paper are longtime contributors to the ParaView scientific visualization application~\cite{Ahrens2005}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ParaView is a general-purpose tool that is used across many scientific domains and that often applies colors in a virtual 3D space. These properties raise unique challenges for color choices }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

\DIFadd{Default colormaps must balance the needs of many users. This raises distinct challenges for colormap construction }\DIFaddend in ParaView and similar \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{products}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{scientific visualizaton software}\DIFaddend .
Care has been taken to choose colors \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and colormaps }\DIFaddend in ParaView that work well in a variety of contexts.
This paper describes the criteria and rationale behind the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{default color choices in ParaView, focusing on the most recent changes to the application.
These changes arise from over 10 years working }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{construction choices in the new default colormap in ParaView.
The criteria and specific changes stem from over a decade of collaboration }\DIFaddend with scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and other institutions.

Early versions of ParaView used the \huewheel, shown \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{in the left of Figure~\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on the left in Figure~\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend , as the default colormap.
This colormap is formed by interpolating along the hues, typically from blue to red, in the HSV color space.
(Note that this colormap is often referred to as the ``Rainbow'' colormap, but we avoid that name to remove confusion with other maps designed with colors from the rainbow.)
\huewheel is a common choice as it is the simplest way to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{produce }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{program }\DIFaddend a sequence of many vibrant colors.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, because these colors are defined by the physics of display technology rather than the physiology of vision, the colors are unevenly distributed and can cause features to be inappropriately accentuated or diminished.
}\DIFdelend Although the criticisms of the \huewheel colormap were known even at the inception of the ParaView software~\cite{Rogowitz1998}, there were few practical alternatives.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend It was when Borland and Taylor~\cite{Borland2007} admonished ParaView \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{by name }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and other visualization programs }\DIFaddend that the developers became motivated to improve their default colormap design.
After adapting the best recommendations available at the time and drawing inspiration from the GIS community, which had extensive color map recommendations~\cite{Brewer2003}, the team settled on a \coolwarm colormap design~\cite{Moreland2009} shown in the center \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{panel }\DIFaddend of Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend .
This map adopts a diverging colormap approach with a smoothed luminance profile in the transition between hues. 
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Since the introduction of the \coolwarm colormap as the default in ParaView, many practitioners have proposed alternate maps~\cite{Samsel2015}, and multiple perceptual studies have been conducted to evaluate these colormaps~\cite{Ware2017}.
Some show that the \coolwarm colormap performs less well than its alternatives, particularly with respect to its discriminability~\cite{Ware2017,Ware2019}.
Consequently, the ParaView development team has been motivated to revisit its default colormap\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and potentially change it}\DIFdelend . 

This paper describes the processes we undertook to design a new default colormap for ParaView, which we dub ``\fast\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.''Use of this colormap  can be seen in the right hand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'', shown on the right }\DIFaddend side of Figure\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend .
We describe the criteria we used in designing this colormap\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, go through the process of iteratively refining colors to get us to our final map, get }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: the iterative design process; refining the hue selection; smoothing the transitions; distributing the final colormap to get }\DIFaddend feedback from current users\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of the software, and use perceptual modelsto make }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; evaluation using perceptual models; and making the }\DIFaddend final refinements.

\DIFaddend \section{CRITERIA}

There are many guidelines for colormaps proposed in the literature. We use the collection compiled by Bujack et al.~\cite{Bujack2018} as a guide. The characteristics most important to us, in no particular order, are as follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Discriminative \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{powers}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{power}\DIFaddend } --
  We wish to maximize the number of just noticeable differences in the colormap to make subtle differences visible.
\item \emph{Uniformity} --
  The perceptual difference between colors should be commensurate with the difference in the numbers they represent.
\item \emph{Smoothness} --
  The rate of change of coloring should be uniform along with the difference in colors themselves.
  This is particularly important for the luminance profile where a sharp change from increasing to decreasing brightness can cause undesired bands.
\item \emph{Order} --
  The color sequence should have an easy to intuit, or at least easy to remember, progression from low to high values.
  The colors should follow natural interpretations and accepted conventions where possible.
\item \emph{Robustness to shading on 3D surfaces} -- Shading, which darkens a surface based on its orientation with respect to the light source and viewer, is vital in perceiving shape.
  If a surface is painted with overly dark colors, the shading becomes indiscernible as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:3d-shading}.
\item \emph{Robustness to colorblindness} --
  The colors should be distinguishable for the many users with various types and degrees of colorblindness.
\item \emph{Aesthetically pleasing} --
  Although quite subjective, ParaView users should generally be pleased with the new colors.

\end{itemize}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{It should be noted that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The Color Theory section below details relevant artistic color theory illuminates why }\DIFaddend these characteristics are not independent, and improvements in one property could degrade the effectiveness in others. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, issues with order, 3D surfaces, or colorblindess are typically resolved by limiting the colors used, but reducing the number of colors lowers the discriminative power of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin 

%DIF > For example, issues with order, 3D surfaces, or colorblindess are typically resolved by limiting the colors used, but reducing the number of colors lowers the discriminative power of the map. Consequently, there is no such thing as the perfect color map. Our default colormap needs to be a jack of all trades even if it is a master at none.



\section {\DIFadd{COLORMAPS \& COLOR THEORY}}
\DIFadd{Colormaps come in a wide variety, categorized loosely by their luminance distribution and number  of ramps. 
%DIF > and designed to address different visualization tasks, data distributions as well as the needs and conventions of the science domain. 
General categories include: discrete, linear, divergent, discrete, isoluminent and more custom constructions such as wave maps. Discrete colormaps contain specific hues without interpolation between hues. Linear maps, colormaps that span one value ramp, enable intuitive identification of scalar values and equalized attention across the visualization but contain lower discriminatory power due to the single value ramp and a narrow range of hues. Divergent maps are colormaps that contain two abutting value ramps which provides addition discriminatory power. }\coolwarm\DIFadd{, }\textit{\DIFadd{Blue=Orange divergent}} \DIFadd{and }\fast \DIFadd{are all examples of divergent maps. Isolumient colormaps hold advantages for specific uses but suffer from low discriminatory power as by definition they seek to limit the luminance range as shown in Figure~\ref{Ware}.
}

\DIFadd{It is helpful to understand a bit about artistic color theory \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Itten} }\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
as a base for our discussion. Colormaps translate data, not through the colors themselves, but }\DIFaddend the \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{contrast}} \DIFadd{between the perceivable hues. In discrete colormaps it is the contrast between the individual hues. Scalar colormaps include the interpolation between the hue control points to create a smooth ramp across the map. Discriminatory power is generated by the contrast of these interpolated hues, thus their selection requires careful consideration and evaluation.

\end{figure*}

\DIFadd{Artistic Color Theory, used and demonstrated in paintings since the Renaissance, identifies seven types of color contrast ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Itten}}\hskip0pt%DIFAUXCMD
.  Contrast of hue, saturation, and luminance are familiar as they align with parameters of HSL color space. The remaining four are: cool-warm contrast; complimentary contrast, both involving colors on opposite sides of the color wheel; simultaneous contrast at play in the }\huewheel \DIFadd{colormap; and contrast of extension which speaks to balance of the area covered by specific hues. Colormaps with high discriminatory power employ multiple types of contrast across the }\DIFaddend map. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Consequently, there is no such thing as the perfect color map.

When constructing colormaps there are always trade-offs about which types and how much contrast should be included. The goal is to maximize the contrast between the internal hues, while maintaining harmony across the colormap. 
}

\DIFadd{Figure~\ref{contrast} illustrates the default colormaps and the types of color contrast discussed above, applied to a data simualtion bow waves in Ganymede's magnetosphere. We clipped the data range to concentrate the contrast in the bow waves, the area of interest.

The bottom row illustrates the types of contrast in isolation, left to right.

}


\DIFadd{Selecting a colormap best suited to specific tasks, datasets and data distributions is key to maximizing the capability of color to translate data, however, it is a time-consuming process.

%DIF > The \huewheel colormap provided adequate discriminatory power when the range of data is small and detail is not required. However, as the data grows, the discriminatory power within colormaps needs to be increased to keep pace. 

The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{most common request we receive from scientists is higher feature resolution, a property driven by the internal contrast levels within the colormap.

Future work includes addressing this trade - off by an automating the re-scaling on the control point distribution.
}



%DIF > It is worth noting that colormaps with larger numbers of control points are able to attain greater discriminatory power due to the greater control of hues sequences. However, here we have limited the number of control points as they make it difficult to adjust the hue distribution to meet the needs of your data while maintaining the even progression of contrast distribution.

\section{\DIFadd{CONSTRUCTING A NEW DEFAULT}}
\DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend origins of the new default color map arise from a collaboration between climate scientists, visualization experts, and visual artists~\cite{Samsel2015}.
The team found that the existing default colors do not reveal enough detail within the high-resolution data they use.
This collaboration engendered the \blueorange colormap (Figure~\ref{fig:design:blueorange}), which better satisfies the needs of the climate scientists~\cite{Samsel2015:SC}.
This colormap is built on the same principles as the \coolwarm colormap (Figure~\ref{fig:design:coolwarm}) but \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with expanded ranges of contrast using more }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{expanded the internal contrast incorporating longer paths through }\DIFaddend hue, saturation, and luminance\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, a principal well documented for increasing internal contrast \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend .  


%DIF < % Our improvement to the default ParaView colormap was an iterative process that is based on Blue Orange diverging \cite{Samsel2015:SC}, a colormap built on the same principles as the \coolwarm colormap but with expanded ranges of contrast of hue, saturation and luminance.

\DIFdelend The \blueorange colormap improves on the discriminating power of \coolwarm by increasing the range of all available color channels without violating robustness to colorblindness.
First, the brightness range is expanded by dropping the brightness at each end.
This increases the luminance profile, which is known to be the most powerful channel for visual discrimination, particularly for high-frequency data \cite{Ware2019}.
The hue range is also expanded by\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{: }\DIFaddend mixing green into the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lighter colorsand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{light cool colors; yellow and orange into to light warm range; and }\DIFaddend moving the darker colors toward purple \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and maroon}\DIFaddend .
The saturation is also significantly increased across the color map to bring more vibrancy and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to }\DIFaddend more clearly distinguish between the hues.
User studies like that in Figure~\ref{Ware}
show the \blueorange colormap to be better than the original \coolwarm colormap and overall one of the best performing colormaps \cite{Ware2017,Ware2019,Turton2017}.

\DIFdelend The success of the \blueorange colormap, which shares features with \coolwarm, suggests that improvements could be made.
A reasonable impulse would be to simply establish \blueorange as the default ParaView colormap.
However, the \blueorange colormap design comes from a particular collaboration with climate scientists studying ocean temperature and is thus developed specifically for their needs.
Because it was created with a narrow focus of customers, it has some characteristics that make it unsuitable for more general application.

%DIF > Figure~\ref{CCC1} shows the control points of \fast in the CCC-Tool\cite{Nardini2021} interface. We start by selecting and adjusting the control points in HSV space (left) as there the hues are intuitively adjustable. Once we are close to a the desired colormap, its control points are reviewed in CIElab (middle) which is useful for tuning the perceptual consistency of the map. In order to check the strength and distribution of the discriminatory power we review in the optimization metrics (bottom) section.

Like yellow, in their pure form they are lighter crisp. When darkened, they quickly become muddy, obscuring the hue.

\DIFdelend \section{PERCEPTUAL EVALUATION}

Although we have not yet had a chance to perform formal human subject studies, we are confident that \fast will outperform its predecessor, \coolwarm, in terms of discriminability.
In particular, \fast has a higher $\Delta$E discriminability metric.
As measured by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{CCC Tool}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CCC-Tool}\DIFaddend ~\cite{Nardini2021}, \coolwarm has an average local CIE$\Delta$E2000 discriminability score of 120 whereas \fast has a score of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{174, and the other }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{174. Other }\DIFaddend discriminability metrics similarly show improvements with \fast.
All that said, we recognize that \fast%
%DIF < , shown in Figure \ref{Ast},
%DIF > , shown in Figure \ref{Larsen3},
likely performs less well in general than the \blueorange colormap it is based on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
This is out of necessity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as }\blueorange \DIFadd{includes a larger luminence range, being darker on the ends and going to white in the center.
These changes were necessary in order }\DIFaddend to adjust for the smoothness and robustness to shading on 3D surfaces.

The \coolwarm colormap was designed about 15 years ago to move away from the \huewheel colormap and its rainbow colors because of the strong evidence at the time of its poor perceptual properties~\cite{Rogowitz1998,Borland2007,Ware1988,Light2004}.
In the interim, multiple colormaps based on the hues of the rainbow that correct some of the problems of the \huewheel have been designed.
More recent research suggests that added hues and more nameable colors can assist in color differentiations that are not otherwise explained by our perceptual color models \cite{Reda2021}.
This leads some to suggest that perceptually correct colormaps based on rainbow colormaps might be favorable \cite{Ware2023}.
Although the \fast colormap does not incorporate all rainbow hues, it does improve dramatically over the hues provided by \coolwarm\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as seen in the hue plots of Figure~\ref{Charts}}\DIFdelend . 

\fast also has more namable colors than its \coolwarm predecessor.
Using the color categorization tendency metric proposed by Reda \cite{Reda2022}, \fast once again exceeds \coolwarm.
Using a color name similarity threshold of 0.6 (as was used by Reda), \coolwarm has a categorization tendency metric of 310 whereas \fast scores 369.
That said, \fast could likely be improved further by completing the rainbow with distinctive green hues (much like the \turbo colormap~\cite{Mikhailov2019} does).
However, these are all recent observations deserving more study, particularly for effects beyond discriminability.
Thus, we are not ready to loop back around to the full hues of a rainbow.


\section{CONCLUSION}

Our final iteration of the new colormap, which we dub ``\fast,'' is demonstrated in Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Ast} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Larsen3} }\DIFaddend as well as numerous other figures in this paper.
This colormap is provided as one of the available colormaps in ParaView~5.12 and will become the default colormap in ParaView~5.13.

Revisiting the criteria presented at the beginning of this paper, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we feel there is a clear advantage of the new colormap}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{evaluations and user feedback show the advantages of }\fast \DIFadd{over }\coolwarm \DIFadd{and other standard defaults. Figure~\ref{Matrix} provides comparisons of the criteria across five data sets}\DIFaddend .

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Discriminative powers} --
  \fast performs better on every color discriminability metric that we have available.
\item \emph{Uniformity} --
  The previous \coolwarm colormap has very little luminance change in its center leaving a region of colors that tend to get washed out (see Figure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{Larsen}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Larsen3}}\DIFaddend ).
  \fast retains more luminance variation at its apex to help maintain a uniform perceptual change in that region.
\item \emph{Smoothness} --
  \fast sacrifices some smoothness at the center for gain in discrimination and uniformity, but the smoothness is close to \coolwarm and much better than \blueorange.
\item \emph{Order} --
  \coolwarm and \fast use the same cues of luminance and warmth for color order.
\item \emph{Robustness to shading on 3D surfaces} --
  \fast allows the end colors to become darker for greater discriminability.
  This makes shapes a bit harder but still possible to discern in the worst case scenario of values all at one end of the colormap range (see Figure~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig:3d-shading}}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{Matrix}, right column}\DIFaddend ).
\item \emph{Robustness to colorblindness} --
  Colorblindness was always kept in mind when designing \fast.
  Figure~\ref{fig:colorblindness} shows that \fast responds just as well to common forms of colorblindness as does \coolwarm.
\item \emph{Aesthetically pleasing} --
  Aesthetics are notoriously difficult to measure with any accuracy.
  However, voluntary responses from ParaView users suggest a preference for \fast.

\end{itemize}



With the introduction of \fast as the default colormap for ParaView, we make a significant improvement in the readability of colors in many visualizations produced. We are proud to have the opportunity to have such a broad impact on the scientific community.
